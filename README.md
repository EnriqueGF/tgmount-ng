# Overview

New version of tgmount


## Requirements
- Linux
- Python?


## Installation:

```
virtualenv .venv3.10 -p python3.10
source .venv3.10/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python cli.py list dialogs
```

## Basic usage

To obtain your API id follow [official manual](https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id).  Running the program for the first time will require authentication.

```
$ export TGAPP=1234567:deadbeef0d04a3efe93e1af778773d6f0 TGSESSION=tgfs
```

To mount a channel/chat/group

```
cli.py mount tgmounttestingchannel ~/mnt/tgmount1/
```

Don't fetch text messages

```
cli.py mount tgmounttestingchannel ~/mnt/tgmount1/ --filter InputMessagesFilterDocument
```

To mount an entity that doesn't have a username you will need to get its id. 
```bash
cli.py list dialogs | grep 'my friends private chat'
```

To mount zip files as directories use `UnpackedZip` producer

```
cli.py mount tgmounttestingchannel ~/mnt/tgmount1/ --producer UnpackedZip
```

Use config file to create a more complex vfs structure  

```
cli.py mount tgmounttestingchannel ~/mnt/tgmount1/ --root-config examples/root_config.yaml
```


## Mounting multiple entities

To mount multiple entities use `mount-config` command

```
cli.py mount-config examples/config.yaml
```

Sample config:
```yaml
# can be overwritten by --mount-dir argument
mount_dir: /home/horn/mnt/tgmount1

client:
  session: tgfs
  api_id: 123
  api_hash: deadbeed121212121

## Config file structure

Config file has the following sections: 
- `client`
- `message_sources`
- `caches`
- `root`

`caches` section is optional.

### Top level properties
```yaml
# 
mount_dir: ~/mnt/tgmount
```
### **`client` section**

Contains settings for the telegram client

```yaml
client:
  # telethon session name 
  session: session_name

  # telegram api credentials
  api_id: int
  api_hash: str

  # optional field
  request_size: 128KB
```

### **`message_sources`** section
A message source defines a list of messages that will be used in vfs tree construction. Every message source is a separate [TelegramClient.get_messages]((https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/modules/client.html#telethon.client.messages.MessageMethods.get_messages)
) request. Message source is also subscribed to events of posting, removing and editing messages in the entity it is sourced from. 

```yaml
message_sources:
  # key defines id of the message source to reference in the `root` section 
  source1: 
    # channel/group/chat id to fetch messages from
    # string or int
    entity: tgmounttestingchannel
    
    # all the following fields are optional

    # whether to listen for updates. Default: true
    updates: True

    # Filter for message types. If not set all the messages types including text 
    # messages will be fetched
    filter: InputMessagesFilterDocument

    # limits the number of messages
    limit: 1000

    offset_id: 0
    min_id: 0
    max_id: 0
    wait_time: None
    reply_to: int
    from_user: str | int
    reverse: False

    # format is `31/12/2023` or '31/12/2023 13:00'
    offset_date: None
```

### `caches` section

Defines cache storages for documents. Cached parts of a document will not be fetched twice. Usually this is not needed because OS file system does the caching by itself. Cache is needed in pair with `UnpackedZip` producer since the OS file system cache is not applied in case of using this producer.

```yaml
caches:
  # the key defines cache id to be referenced in `root` section
  cache1:
    # currently only memory cache is supported 
    type: memory
    # The size of the cache
    capacity: 300MB
    # optional block size, default: 128KB
    block_size: 256KB
```

### `root` section

This section defines the structure of the mounted folder.

```yaml
root:
  # optional. sets the message source for the current directory. If this is not
  # set and there is no recursive filter has been defined before, the folder 
  # will not contain any files
  source: source1

  # same
  source: {source: source1}

  # sets the message source for the current and for nested folders
  source: {source: source1, recursive: True}
  
  # optional. sets a filter for the current folder. Default is no filter
  filter: MessageWithMusic
  filter: {filter: MessageWithMusic}

  # sets a filter for the current folder and subfolders
  filter: {filter: MessageWithMusic, recursive: True}

  # sets a filter for the current folder and subfolders overwriting another recursive filter if any 
  filter: {filter: MessageWithMusic, overwright: True, recursive: True}

  # the following combines multiple filters. Only messages that match every filter
  # in the list will pass. The filter below allows all documents that
  # that are not video, photo or audio and not a zip file 
  filter: 
    - MessageWithOtherDocument
    - Not:
      - ByExtension: .zip

  # defines a producer that controls the content of the folder. 
  # Default is PlainDir
  producer: BySender

  # producer may have properties
  producer: 
    BySender:
      dir_structure:
        music: 
          filter: MessageWithMusic
        voices: 
          filter: MessageWithVoice
      use_get_sender: true

  # sets a cache for the current folder
  # referencing a cache defined in `caches` folder 
  cache: memory1

  # dynamicaly creates a cache to use in this folder
  cache: 
    type: memory
    capacity: 300MB

  # optional. wrapper that modifies the resulting content of the folder 
  wrapper: ExcludeEmptyDirs

  # optional. Defines the priority of how to classify messages if multiple classes
  # match its type. E.g. a message with both a document and a text message  
  treat_as: MessageWithText

  # to define subfolders
  documents:
    # 'documents' folder will only contain the two following subfolders 
    docs_from_source1:
      source: source1
      filter: MessageWithDocument
    docs_from_source2:  
      source: source2
      filter: MessageWithDocument
```


#### `source`

Message source is a list of messages which is used to produce a directory content. Message source is initialized from get_messages() request and is updated by events of posting message, removing message and editing message in the corresponding entity. 

Producer is subscribed to a message source and takes a care of the directory it is responsible for. It manages it by adding and removing files and subfolders.

The content of a folder is defined by a combination of properties `source`, `filter`, `producer` and `treat_as`. 

This will defined a tree of empty folders
```yaml
root:
  everything:
  photos:
  texts:
  round-and-voice:
    rounds:
    voices:
```
The config will result into
```
/everything
/photos
/texts
/round-and-voice
/round-and-voice/rounds
/round-and-voice/voices
```
To fill the directories with files we need to specify a source for every folder that is supposed to contain files
```yaml
root:
  everything:
    source: source1 
  photos:
    source: source1
  texts:
    source: source1
  round-and-voice:
    rounds:
      source: source1
    voices:
      source: source1
```

In result every directory that has `source` property will contain all the files from the specified source.

Let's add filters 

```yaml
root:
  everything:
    # don't need filter here
    source: source1
  photos:
    source: source1
    filter: MessageWithCompressedPhoto
  texts:
    source: source1
    filter: MessageWithText
    treats_as: MessageWithText
  round-and-voice:
    rounds:
      source: source1
      filter: MessageWithKruzhochek
    voices:
      source: source1
      filter: MessageWithVoice
```
as soon as the only source used in the structure is `source1` we can get rid of repeating it by using `recursive` property of the source.

```yaml
root:
  source: {source: source1, recursive: True}
  everything:
    filter: All
  photos:
    filter: MessageWithCompressedPhoto
  texts:
    filter: MessageWithText
    treats_as: MessageWithText
  round-and-voice:
    rounds:
      filter: MessageWithKruzhochek
    voices:
      filter: MessageWithVoice
```

Note that
1. The root itself will not contain any files because source with recursive flag doesn't trigger file producing
2. We had to specify `filter` in `everything` to trigger file producer. For the same effect we could have also specified a producer.
```yaml
everything:
  # triggers producing from the recusrive filter
  producer: PlainDir
```  

#### `filters`

By message type:

```python
MessageWithDocument # Message with a document attached (message with compressed
#  image doesn't match) 
MessageWithCompressedPhoto # with a compressed image
MessageDownloadable # `MessageWithDocument` or `MessageWithCompressedPhoto`
MessageWithAnimated # stickers, gifs
MessageWithAudio # voices and music
MessageWithVoice # voice
MessageWithKruzhochek # round video
MessageWithDocumentImage # uncompressed image
MessageWithFilename # document with a filename attribute
MessageWithMusic # music
MessageWithVideo # round video, video documents, stickers, gifs
MessageWithVideoFile # video documents
MessageWithSticker # sticker
MessageWithOtherDocument # Any document
MessageWithZip # zip file
MessageWithText # message with text message
MessageWithoutDocument # message witn no document and no photo
MessageWithReactions # message with reactions
MessageForwarded # forwarded message

# Telegram filters
InputMessagesFilterPhotos     # MessageWithCompressedPhoto
InputMessagesFilterVideo      # MessageWithVideo
InputMessagesFilterPhotoVideo # MessageWithCompressedPhoto | MessageWithVideo
InputMessagesFilterDocument   # MessageWithDocument
InputMessagesFilterGif        # MessageWithAnimated
InputMessagesFilterVoice      # MessageWithVoice
InputMessagesFilterMusic      # MessageWithMusic
InputMessagesFilterRoundVideo # MessageWithKruzhochek
InputMessagesFilterRoundVoice # MessageWithKruzhochek | MessageWithVoice
```

Other filters

```yaml
# Filter wrapper to negatiate filter. 
Not: MessageWithReactions

# Combines multiple filters. If any matches
Union: 
  - MessageWithDocumentImage
  - MessageWithCompressedPhoto

# Combines multiple filters. If all matches
And:
  - MessageForwarded
  - MessageWithVideo

# same as
filter: [MessageForwarded, MessageWithVideo]

# takes first `count` messages
First:
  count: 10

# takes last `count` messages
Last:
  count: 10

# Filter by filename extension
ByExtension: .zip

# will only leave unique docs
OnlyUniqueDocs:
  # optional. Control which document first appeared or last appeared will stay.
  # default: first
  picker: last 
  picker: first 

# passby filter. Used to command tgmount to producer content in the folder
# or to reset recursive filter
All

# sequentially filters messages. Last 10 unique documents 
Seq:
  - MessageWithDocument
  - OnlyUniqueDocs
  - Last: 10

# matches reactions
ByReaction:
  reaction: üëç
  # optional. default: 1
  minimum: 5
